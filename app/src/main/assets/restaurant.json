If you want a taste of the latter, consider ordering the Emily, which is topped with mozzarella, pistachios, truffled sottocenere cheese, and honey. The menu includes salads and a handful of starters, as well as a burger that some meat connoisseurs consider to be among the best in the city."

					"comments": "5 star atmosphere as it is very cozy with great staff. 5 star food as their Emmy burger is outrageously good. and its on a pretzel bun.. Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worth competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. when you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner. But, if you go a step further and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and the spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same time."

The banchan plates are uniformly good, and Deuki Hong’s menu also includes winning dishes like stir-fried squid noodles, kimchi stew, and seafood pancakes. If it’s available, make sure to order the kimchi and rice “lunchbox.” Baekjeong is a great place for large groups and birthday parties."

					"comments": "I've been to Korea before and many other Korean BBQ places. We had the regular pork belly and a beef (forgot which cut) and a seafood tofu soup. Two meat and a soup was just prefect for the two of us. We could have done one meat and one soup. The portions of the meat are great! The beef was juicy, tender and so good. The sides were excellent.
